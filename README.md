# Hermes - Driving The ACROPOLIS Network

Here, a management software for autonomous sensor networks is created.

The system is made of three parts: the sensors themselves, the server, and the dashboard.

The sensors communicate with the server via MQTT. The server stores the data in a database and provides a REST API for the dashboard.

## Main goals ðŸŽ¯

1. The status and measurements of the sensors can be observed in real-time and remotely
1. The sensors can be configured remotely
1. The software on the sensors can be updated remotely
1. Easy setup and deployment of tentacruel

## Practical usage ðŸ“¦

This software is developed for the ACROPOLIS project. The goal of ACROPOLIS is to measure CO2 concentrations with very high precision in the city of Munich. The network spans 20 sensors.
